  summary: 'A package to perform the analysis of multiphase porous reactive materials'
  description: |
    The Porous material Analysis Toolbox (PATO) is a modular analysis platform for multiphase porous 
    reactive materials. It can be run as a simple Fourier heat transfer code or include more advanced 
    features as internal decomposition (pyrolysis, vaporization), gas-gas and gas-solid chemical 
    interactions (combustion, cracking, coking), gas species transport (convection, diffusion), and 
    solid morphology evolutions (internal density changes, surface ablation). PATO is implemented as 
    a C++ top level module of the open source (GNU GPL) computational fluid dynamics software program 
    OpenFOAM. PATO also uses the open source (GNU LGPL) thermodynamics, transport, and chemistry library 
    Mutation++ produced by the von Karman Institute for Fluid Dynamics.
